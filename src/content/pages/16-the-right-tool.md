* Different situations = different tools
* We have quite a few options
  * CSS transitions
  * CSS animations
  * SMIL _(yes, this still exists)_
  * [Web animation API](https://drafts.csswg.org/web-animations/)
  * JS Libraries
  * `requestAnimationFrame`
* Mix and match
* Categorising UI animations types can help
