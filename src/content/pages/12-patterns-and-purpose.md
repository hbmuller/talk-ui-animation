### Patterns
* **Transitions** take users from place to place in the information space, or transition them out of one task into another. These tend to have massive impacts on the content on the page, replacing large portions of information.
* **Supplements** bring information on or o  the page, but don’t change the user’s “location” or task. They generally add or update bits of additional content on the page.
* **Feedback** indicates causation between two or more events, often used to connect a user’s interaction with the interface’s reaction.
* **Demonstrations** explain how something works or expose its details by showing instead of telling.
* **Decorations** do not convey new information and are purely aesthetic.

### Purpose
* Information architecture
* Demonstrating is clearer than explaining
* Reinforcing branding
* Reduce cognitive bottlenecks
* Prioritization
